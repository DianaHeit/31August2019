# Learnings of the day! 1. typo psycho 2. return false

# 1st: typo in 
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js">
  </script> 
# which used to be ... scr ... returned the error "function signUp is not defined" in the console

# 2nd: 

# including ; return false; in my submit button prevents the page from reloading --> happy!

# works if you define the function with return false; either in the code of the submit button or the external .js
